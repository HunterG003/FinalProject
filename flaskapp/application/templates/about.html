    <h2>About our project</h2>
 <p>Our objective was to build off of our topic from the first project, COVID's effect on Spotify streaming data. We noticed that the biggest change in the number of streams was in the later months of 2020 (the holiday season). Spotify activity more than doubled during that part of the year. The theory is that in 2019 we all traveled and gathered which lead to fewer households playing music. 2020 found us all in our own homes which would explain the increase in streams. We wanted to add some domestic flight data to show the correlation to less travel equating to more people at home doing solo listening. 

        With that being said, I will now pass it over to â€”-----  to talk about where we looked for the data and our exploitory journey to sourcing our data.
